 1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum fields as the Orders table, and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers
table, so that each customerâ€™s order will be entered into this table along with his or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. All of the fields in
Cityorders will be constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. Assume
the parent keys in these tables already have the proper constraints.*/
        
      use akshay;
          create table cityorders select onum,amt,snum,cnum,city  from orders natural join customer;

       or 
       create table cityorders select o.onum,o.amt,o.snum,c.cnum,c.city  from orders o,customer c where o.cnum=c.cnum;

       alter table cityorder add primary key (onum);

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2) Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which willidentify, for each order, the onum of the previous order for that current customer.
Implement this with a foreign key referring to the Orders table itself. The foreign key should refer as well to the cnum of the customer, providing a definite
enforced link between the current order and the one referenced.*/

desc customers;

     alter table cityorders add column prev int;
      alter table cityorders add constraint FK_city FOREIGN KEY(prev) REFERENCES orders(onum);
     alter table customer modify cnum int(4) NOT NULL;
    alter table customer add primary key(cnum);
     alter table cityorders add constraint cnum_fk FOREIGN key(cnum) REFERENCES customer(cnum);
